Requirements
============
*(last update: Oct 30th, 2013)*

A formal requirements specification lets all users and developers to be aware of the features the project has - and will have in future releases, and also to make a quick review of what the development state is.  
Moreover, it is possible for volunteers to plan what to concentrate on in the early stages of development process.

Requirements are differentiated in four groups: the functional ones represent what the application will do; interface requirements tell how the app will appear to the final user; design requirements are a basic guideline for developers; inverse requirements state what the application must not do.  
For clarity purpose, each requirement has a unique number.

In the following statements, this glossary is to be considered:

* *voter* is the person submitting votes;
* *competitor* is the person the vote is given to - it may also be a parameter;
* *user* is the one using the application, i.e., the person who aggregates votes.

When a requirement number is followed by parenthesis with another requirement number, it means the further depends from the latter's implementation.

Also, three priority levels are given:

* MUST indicates the requirement to be absolutely implemented - someday
* SHOULD stands for strongly suggested, but not necessary, requirements
* MAY is for optional stuff

As development state goes on, MUST requirements will be implemented, this meaning that SHOULD ones gain priority, and so on.  
By the way, this list is all but exhaustive: anyone can improve it - or suggest some points to be canceled. Software is an evolving entity.

FR20 The application MAY aggregate votes without considering best and/or worst *m* votes  
FR21 The votes MAY express a yes/no judgment  
FR22 The votes MAY express a voter-related "top *n*"¬ù classification

Design Requirements
-------------------

DR01 Configuration screen or wizard MUST be reachable from any point when the application is running  
DR02 (done) Aggregation formulas MUST lie in a separate class  
DR03 The number of duplicate lines MUST be reduced to the minimum, encouraging utility classes  

Inverse Requirements
--------------------

IR01 The application MUST NOT fail without giving informations about what happened.
IR02(IR01) The cause of failures SHOULD NOT be the error stacktrace.

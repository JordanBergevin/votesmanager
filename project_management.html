          <h1>Project Management</h1>

<p>As an Open Source project, it is important to immediately point out the role the different components of the Community will have.<br />
Besides the usual roles, this project tends to spread the concept of collaboration: not only the Community has a fundamental role, but also the Management Team will be composed by many people and will tightly work together for the project to grow up in size and functionalities.</p>

<h2>
<a name="mgmt-team" class="anchor" href="#mgmt-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Management Team</h2>

<p>Decisions should never be taken by individuals. Thus, the creation of a Management Team is to be planned.</p>

<p>The Management Team must be formed by:
<ul>
<li>One person who represents the potential user;</li>
<li>At least one developer for each platform the project will be developed for.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The role of the Management Team is to evaluate and accept (or eventually reject) project-wide or multi-platform-related Community submissions.<br />
Communications between the Managemet Team members are to be published, in the worst case just after the decision took place.</p>

<p>The developers being part of the Management Team will automatically act as Subproject Manager, the Subproject being the branch of project regarding a particular platform.<br />
Subproject Managers are the only people who could eventually reject a Community submission (see below), as long as it does not affect other Subprojects.<br />
Subproject Managers will assign tasks to people and control their development and realization. For no reason but a developer's request or reiterate unanswered solicitations, the developer can be removed from a task after its assignment.</p>

<h2>
<a name="other-managers" class="anchor" href="#other-managers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Managers</h2>

<p>
Should the project grow up enough, some other specialized figures are to contribute to the project management.
<ul>
<li>A <em>Documentation Manager</em> will care about the consistence between development and documentation status</li>
<li>A <em>Patch Manager</em> will probably become necessary when many patches will be provided, in order to both submit them to committers and track possible duplicates</li>
<li>A <em>Translation Manager</em> will coordinate different documentation and application translation, and will cooperate with both Documentation Manager and Management Team</li>
<li>An <em>Issue Manager</em> will check issue tracker and talk to the Management Team to plan solution releases</li>
<li>A <em>FAQ Manager</em> will provide a point of contact for FAQ requests and adding</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>All these figures are to be considered when the project will have a widespread community and tons of contributors. In this first stage, all roles will be provided within the Management Team.<br />
The group of managers may eventually take the place of the Management Team, should everyone agree about it.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="community" class="anchor" href="#community"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Community</h2>

<p>As usual in Open Source projects, the Community may contribute in many forms: by suggesting new functionalities, by submitting bugs (and possibly their fixing), by implementing open tasks, by checking other people's code. Also non-development work is needed, e.g. to create the user manual or to check code documentation. In other words, any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>The Management Team must encourage Community contributions by accepting the highest number of new functionality requests and by assigning open tasks to Community members, instead of Management Team members.<br />
Any decision against the work of a Community member must be clearly and privately explained; should the decision affect a large number of Community members, it should be explained in a public page.</p>

<p>Design requirements are to be followed by all developers, and this is one reason a submission could be rejected.  
Community members must act according to software licenses and common law.</p>

<p>Any piece of code submitted to the project should have been previously tested within the application following the checklist that will be published on the project website and/or the repository.</p>

<p>Only the Community member a task was assigned to can ask to be removed from it.</p>

<h2>
<a name="contributors-needed" class="anchor" href="#contributors-needed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributors Needed</h2>

<p>This section will hold roles the Management Team or other managers feel lack of.<br />
It must be kept up-to-date as much as possible.</p>

<p>Anyway, contributors are not to be limited to these roles - it wouldn't be an open source project.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Developers - Android developers, Java developers (utilities and test classes can be just POJOs)</li>
<li>Translators - Italian first, for both documentation and string resources</li>
<li>Testers (please provide the device you will get the application on)</li>
<li>Reviewers for both docs and code</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
<a name="resources-needed" class="anchor" href="#resources-needed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources Needed</h2>

<p>Do you wish to contribute with something different? The project is still in early stage, so there is not only need for contributors, but also for resources.</p>

<p>What we have:
<ul>
<li>Git repository</li>
<li>Mailing lists</li>
<li>Website (on GitHub)</li>
</ul>
What we don't have:
<ul>
<li>Web Domain</li>
<li>Forum</li>
<li>IRC channel (and people to follow it intensively)</li>
</ul>
What we could change:
<ul>
<li>Mailing lists - in order to have lists with the same domain of the website</li>
<li>Website</li>
</ul>
If you want to offer your help and resources with one of these points, please contact the project author.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="release-guidelines" class="anchor" href="#release-guidelines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Release Guidelines</h2>

<p>The first public stable release, called Release 1.0, will have all <i>must</i> functional <a href="http://dturrina.github.io/votesmanager/requirements.html">requirements</a> satisfied and tested.<br />
The Management Team could define Alpha and Beta releases in order to let the Community test newly-introduced functionality, without any warranty about the application to be fully running and free of bugs.</p>

<p>Micro (3rd-level) releases will bring <em>only</em> security updates or bug fixes; Minor releases should implement a single or few features and be backwards and forwards compatible, that is, switching a modified class between a minor and its previous/next version will not change the user experience (besides of utility classes, every minor-released class must be modular). Major releases hold all previous minor releases' features and/or big interface changes.<br />
Some widely-impacting or particularly complex features are to be destined for major releases.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, no deadline is to be given to a Community member, although the Community member itself is encouraged to give a <em>probable release date</em>.<br />
This does not apply when the Management Team plans a new release.</p>

<p>It is suggested for each implemented requirement to take trace of all people who contributed in its realizing, and for each bug-fixing release to cite the bug reporters and solvers.</p>

          <h1>Bug Reporting</h1>
          <p><em>(last update: Nov 4th, 2013)</em></p>

          <h2>What's a bug?</h2>
          <p>
A bug is not (only) an unexpected behavior the application has. If you think the application <em>is doing it wrong</em>, please check the documentation (more specifically, the user manual) before submitting it as a bug.<br />
<em>As the User's Manual isn't available yet, and we don't have so many testers, simply go to next step.</em><br />
A bug is an *incorrect* behavior the application has: some unexpected behavior may derive from a first, very basic version of the implemented feature. Developers are strongly invited to indicate such behaviors in order not to make users confused. These kind of partly or unimplemented features can be found inside TODO lists and/or Issue page - better on both.<br />
Should you verify that behavior is <em>really</em> wrong, then keep in mind the following instructions when reporting it as a bug.
</p>

<h2>Where to Report a Bug</h2>

<p>We dedicated a <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/bugs-votesmanager">mailing list</a> to bug reports.<br />
In (very) future releases, it is likely that other lists will be created.</p>

<p>As all our mailing lists are moderated, it is unlikely for your request to be immediately seen on the mailing list archive. Once a bug is recognized as a <em>bug</em>, it will be reported in Issue page as well; from this moment on, anyone could offer the solution and you'll finally see your bug (better, the bug you saw) fixed!</p>

<h2>When to report a bug</h2>

<p>Again, please be sure that unexpected behavior is a bug.</p>

<p>Should you be sure it is a bug, follow this checklist:<br />
<ul>
<li>Are you using the latest version of the application? If not, the bug may have been fixed in the next releases.</li>
<li>Try to reproduce it in a minimalistic scenario, i.e., with the smallest number of data - as the application manipulates data.</li>
<li>Describe both the expected and the observed behavior.</li>
<li>Give a reproduction recipe: tell exactly what data you used, where you put them, and how. Screenshots are definitely useful.</li>
<li>Describe your environment: operating system (version), VotesManager version/build, device and any other information you can collect - better to read more than not to know enough! (A log trace is the best thing you can give us.)</li>
<li>Should you guess what causes the bug and know how to fix it - wow, it's time to submit a patch!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>That's it! Yes, it's a quite long work to submit a bug - but with your effort you're saving maybe hours of work to some other person! Who knows better than <em>you</em> what happened?</p>

<p>Oh, and... thanks for caring about our work - we really appreciate it.</p>

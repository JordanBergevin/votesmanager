          <h1>Requirement List</h1>
        
          <p><em>(last update: Oct 30th, 2013)</em></p>

<p>A formal requirements specification lets all users and developers to be aware of the features the project has - and will have in future releases, and also to make a quick review of what the development state is.<br />
Moreover, it is possible for volunteers to plan what to concentrate on in the early stages of development process.</p>

<p>Requirements are differentiated in four groups: the functional ones represent what the application will do; interface requirements tell how the app will appear to the final user; design requirements are a basic guideline for developers; inverse requirements state what the application must not do.<br />
For clarity purpose, each requirement has a unique number.</p>

<p>In the following statements, this glossary is to be considered:
  <ul>
    <li><i>voter</i> is the person submitting votes;</li>
    <li><i>competitor</i> is the person the vote is given to - it may also be a parameter;</li>
    <li><i>user</i> is the one using the application, i.e., the person who aggregates votes.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>When a requirement number is followed by parenthesis with another requirement number, it means the further depends from the latter's implementation.</p>

<p>Also, three priority levels are given:
  <ul>
    <li>MUST indicates the requirement to be absolutely implemented - someday</li>
    <li>SHOULD stands for strongly suggested, but not necessary, requirements</li>
    <li>MAY is for optional stuff</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>As development state goes on, MUST requirements will be implemented, this meaning that SHOULD ones gain priority, and so on.<br />
By the way, this list is all but exhaustive: anyone can improve it - or suggest some points to be canceled. Software is an evolving entity.</p>

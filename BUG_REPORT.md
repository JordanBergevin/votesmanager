Bug Reporting
=============
*(last update: Oct 15th, 2013)*

What's a bug?
-------------
A bug is not (only) an unexpected behavior the application has. If you think the application *is doing it wrong*, please check the documentation (more specifically, the user manual) before submitting it as a bug.  
A bug is an *incorrect* behavior the application has: some unexpected behavior may derive from a first, very basic version of the implemented feature. Developers are strongly invited to indicate such behaviors in order not to make users confused.  
Should you verify that behavior is *really* wrong, then keep in mind the following instructions when reporting it as a bug.

Where to Report a Bug
---------------------

We dedicated a mailing list to bug reports: bugs-votesmanager@freelists.org.  
In (very) future releases, it is likely that other lists will be created.

When to report a bug
--------------------

Again, please be sure that unexpected behavior is a bug.  
Should you not be sure, please check the mailing lists or write to users-votesmanager@freelists.org.

Should you be sure it is a bug, follow this checklist:

* Are you using the latest version of the application? If not, the bug may have been fixed in the next releases.
* Try to reproduce it in a minimalistic scenario, i.e., with the smallest number of data - as the application manipulates data.
* Describe both the expected and the real behavior.
* Give a reproduction recipe: tell exactly what data you put, in what places, and how. Screenshots are definitely useful.
* Describe your environment: operating system (version), VotesManager version/build, device and any other information you can collect - better to read more than not to know enough!
* Should you guess what causes the bug and know how to fix it - wow, it's time to submit a patch!

That's it! Yes, it's a quite long work to submit a bug - but with your effort you're saving maybe hours of work to some other person! Who knows better than *you* what happened?

Oh, and... thanks for caring about our work - we really appreciate it.

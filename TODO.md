TODOs, i.e., What Is Needed Now
===============================

*last update: Nov 4th, 2013*

This page highlights what is mostly needed at the moment, as a guideline for potential contributors to have an idea of what to do. It is usually a short, highest-priority list taken from the [Issue page](https://github.com/dturrina/votesmanager/issues).  
Remember all [requirements](http://dturrina.github.io/votesmanager/requirements.html) are to be done, someday.  

At the moment, the application can load and save data from a file named *data.xml* stored on the device SD card.  
Should this file not be found, the application will load data from a default *data.xml* file stored between application assets. Data will then be stored on the SD card upon every tap on "Submit votes" button.

What We Mostly Need Now
-----------------------

* (Issue #1 - unassigned) Implement application settings for *data.xml* filename and content and aggregation algorithm  
* (Issue #2 - unassigned) Prepare repository for use with both Eclipse with Android SDK and Android Studio
* (Issue #3 - unassigned) Write a simple user manual for current application
* (Issue #4 - unassigned) Write a test plan for current functionalities  

Volounteers for the cited tasks are pleased to contact the author.

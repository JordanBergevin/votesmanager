TODOs, i.e., What Is Needed Now
===============================

*last update: Oct 30th, 2013*

This page highlights what is mostly needed at the moment, as a guideline for potential contributors to have an idea of what to do.  
The complete TODO list corresponds to the [Requirement](https://github.com/dturrina/votesmanager/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md) list.  

At the moment, the application can load and save data from a file named *data.xml* stored on the device SD card.  
Should this file not be found, the application will load data from a default *data.xml* file stored between application assets. Data will then be stored on the SD card upon every tap on "Submit votes" button.

What We Mostly Need Now
-----------------------

* (unassigned) Write a test plan for current functionalities  
* (unassigned) Implement application settings for *data.xml* filename and content and aggregation algorithm  
* (unassigned) Write a simple user manual for current application
* (unassigned) Prepare repository for use with both Eclipse with Android SDK and Android Studio

Volounteers for the cited tasks are pleased to contact the author.
